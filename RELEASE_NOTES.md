# Release Notes

## stable-1.15-2.4.0, stable-1.16-2.4.0, stable-1.17-2.4.0

* Istio:
  - The "kubernetes-service-monitor" service monitor has been removed. ([#481](https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-base-addons/pull/481), [@gracedo](https://github.com/gracedo))

  - Bumped Istio to v1.6.8:
    - Fixed security issues:
      - CVE-2020-12603: By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could cause Envoy to consume excessive amounts of memory when proxying HTTP/2 requests or responses.
      - CVE-2020-12605: An attacker could cause Envoy to consume excessive amounts of memory when processing specially crafted HTTP/1.1 packets.
      - CVE-2020-8663: An attacker could cause Envoy to exhaust file descriptors when accepting too many connections.
      - CVE-2020-12604: An attacker could cause increased memory usage when processing specially crafted packets.
      - CVE-2020-15104: When validating TLS certificates, Envoy incorrectly allows a wildcard DNS Subject Alternative Name to apply to multiple subdomains. For example, with a SAN of   .example.com, Envoy incorrectly allows nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow subdomain.example.com.
      - CVE-2020-16844: Callers to TCP services that have a defined Authorization Policies with DENY actions using wildcard suffixes (e.g. *-some-suffix) for source principals or namespace fields will never be denied access.
    - Other changes:
      - Fixed return the proper source name after Mixer does a lookup by IP if multiple pods have the same IP.
      - Improved the sidecar injection control based on revision at a per-pod level (Issue 24801)
      - Improved istioctl validate to disallow unknown fields not included in the Open API specification (Issue 24860)
      - Changed stsPort to sts_port in Envoyâ€™s bootstrap file.

      - Updated WASM state to log for Access Log Service.
      - Increased default protocol detection timeout from 100 ms to 5 s (Issue 24379)
      - Removed UDP port 53 from Istiod.
      - Allowed setting status.sidecar.istio.io/port to zero (Issue 24722)
      - Fixed EDS endpoint selection for subsets with no or empty label selector. (Issue 24969)
      - Allowed k8s.overlays on BaseComponentSpec. (Issue 24476)

      - Optimized performance in scenarios with large numbers of gateways. (Issue 25116)
      - Fixed an issue where out of order events may cause the Istiod update queue to get stuck. This resulted in proxies with stale configuration.

      - Fixed long log messages for clusters with many gateways.
      - Fixed outlier detection to only fire on user configured errors and not depend on success rate. (Issue 25220)

      - Fixed Bookinfo demo application to verify if a specified namespace exists and if not, use the default namespace.
      - Added a label to the pilot_xds metric in order to give more information on data plane versions without scraping the data plane.
      - Added CA_ADDR field to allow configuring the certificate authority address on the egress gateway configuration and fixed the istio-certs mount secret name.
      - Updated Bookinfo demo application to latest versions of libraries.
      - Updated Istio to disable auto mTLS when sending traffic to headless services without a sidecar.
      - Fixed an issue which prevented endpoints not associated with pods from working. (Issue &#35;25974) ([#489](https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-base-addons/pull/489), [@shaneutt](https://github.com/shaneutt))
