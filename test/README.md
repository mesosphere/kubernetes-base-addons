# Addon Tests

In this directory you will find [go tests](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/) which cover integration testing of the addons in this repo.

This uses the [Kubeaddons](https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons) addon testing framework, which is [documented here](https://github.com/mesosphere/kubeaddons/blob/master/docs/test/framework.md).
