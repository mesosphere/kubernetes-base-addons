<!--  Thanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:

1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-base-addons/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
2. When you're changing an existing addon, please do so with at least 2 commits:

   1. create a copy of the addon spec file without doing any changes
   2. change the copy

   That way it’s much easier to review what actually has been changed.
